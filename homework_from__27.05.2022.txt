— 6) For each maker producing laptops with a hard drive capacity of 10 Gb or higher, find the speed of such laptops. Result set: maker, speed.

SELECT DISTINCT 
	t1.maker, 
	t2.speed
FROM Product t1
LEFT JOIN Laptop t2
ON t2.model = t1.model
WHERE hd >= 10; 
— 7) Find out the models AND prices for ALL the products (of any TYPE) produced BY maker B.

SELECT
	t2.model,
	t1.price	
FROM PC t1
INNER JOIN Product t2

— 9) Find the makers of PCs with a processor speed of 450 MHz or more. Result set: maker.

SELECT maker AS Maker
FROM Product t1
LEFT JOIN PC t2
ON t1.model = t2.model
WHERE t2.speed >= 450
GROUP BY maker;


— 14) For the ships in the Ships table that have at least 10 guns, get the class, name, and country.


SELECT 
	t1.class,

FROM Ships t1
INNER JOIN Classes t2

WHERE t2.numGuns >= 10;




— 16) Get pairs of PC models with identical speeds and the same RAM capacity.
— Each resulting pair should be displayed only once, i.e. (i, j) but not (j, i). 
— Result set: model with the bigger number, model with the smaller number, speed, and RAM.
 SELECT DISTINCT 
	t1.model, 
	t2.model, 
	t1.speed, 
	t1.ram

AND t1.ram = t2.ram
WHERE t1.model > t2.model;

— 29) Under the assumption that receipts of money (inc) and payouts (out) are registered not
— more than once a day for each collection point [i.e. the primary key consists of (point, date)], 
— write a query displaying cash flow data (point, date, income, expense). 
— Use Income_o and Outcome_o tables.

SELECT 
	t1.point, 
	t1.date, 
	t1.inc,
	t2.out
FROM Income_o t1 
LEFT JOIN Outcome_o t2

— 34) In accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty concluded in the beginning of 1922, it was prohibited to build — battle ships with a displacement of more than 35 thousand tons. 
— Get the ships violating this treaty (only consider ships for which the year of launch is known). 
— List the names of the ships.

SELECT DISTINCT 
	name 
FROM Classes AS t1 
JOIN Ships AS t2
ON t1.class = t2.class 
WHERE launched >= 1922 
AND displacement > 35000
AND TYPE = 'bb‘;

— 36) List the names of lead ships in the database (including the Outcomes table).

SELECT 
	name
FROM Ships

SELECT 
	class
FROM Classes
)

UNION

SELECT 
	ship
FROM Outcomes
WHERE ship IN (
SELECT 
	class
